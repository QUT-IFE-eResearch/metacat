:: Command-line XSLT 
:: 
:: Takes 3 command-line arguments: 
:: 1) an existing XML document, 
:: 2) an existing XSL document, and 
:: 3) an HTML document (existing or not) 
:: It then uses the XSL document to transform 
:: the XML into HTML. 
:: (Note that HTML is the common usage - however, 
:: many other types of output documents are supported, 
:: limited only buy the XSL stylesheet itself)
::
:: TROUBLESHOOTING:
::   
:: i) ASSUMES the existence of:
::              .\lib\xalan.jar, 
::              .\lib\xalan.jar\xercesImpl.jar, and 
::              .\lib\xalan.jar\xml-apis.jar
:: 
:: ii) Use absolute paths, not relative paths, for 
:: the XML, XSL and HTML files. Make sure file paths 
:: do NOT have spaces in them (eg - NOT like: c:\Program Files\)
::

IF NOT EXIST %1 GOTO USAGE
IF NOT EXIST %2 GOTO USAGE

SET LIB=.\lib

SET CPATH=%LIB%\xalan.jar;%LIB%\xercesImpl.jar;%LIB%\xml-apis.jar


:: transformer parameters that are usually set by the java 
:: code in morpho or in metacat. We have to pass them on the command line:

SET TPARAMS=-PARAM qformat knb -PARAM action read
